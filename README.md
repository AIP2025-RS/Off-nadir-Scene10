# Off-nadir-Scene10 Dataset

The Off-nadir-Scene10 dataset can be downloaded through the following two links:

(1) Baidu Cloud Drive (百度网盘): https://pan.baidu.com/s/1DdGmylrhFz60NLc1WoovLA,   Access code (提取码): OffN

(2) Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x-Wy5WCes9GAGjAG4T03lDVSOgnnEBHV/view?usp=sharing

Each image file name in the dataset consists of three parts:
(a) The category name
(b) The region ID corresponding to a specific location within that category
(c) The off-nadir angle ID

For example, the image file named baseball diamond_1_OA8.tif represents a baseball diamond category image, corresponding to region 1 of that category, with an off-nadir angle ID of OA8.
